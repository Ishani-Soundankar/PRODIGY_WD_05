# Weather App 
I have attempted to create a Weather Web Application using a public API that retrieves weather data from a weather API based on the user-inputted location. Display the current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant information.
I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this project. 

## How to Use This Weather Web Application

1. Duplicate the `config.sample.js` file and rename it as `config.js`
2. Replace `"add_yOUR_API_KEY"` with your own API key. 
3. Open your html file in your browser to use the application.
